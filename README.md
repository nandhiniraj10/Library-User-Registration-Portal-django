<h2>Project Abstract:</h2><br>
The Library Registration System is a web application built with Django that enables users to register their details related to book borrowing. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their name, contact information, address, selected books, the total amount, and the number of books being borrowed. Upon successful submission, the information is saved to the database, and users receive a confirmation page displaying their submitted details. This system simplifies the registration process for library users, making it easy to manage and track book borrowing activities.
